Year: 2663

After making several losses in your energy business, developing a next generation of enhanced nuclear power reactors, you ended up financially bankrupt and stay left incapacitatded. Your tech partners have already disappeared and five handful of clients demand their investments back. Well, those 1.7 million won't gain from nowhere and your private accounts have already been seized. Before the  authorities of the Clans Union would accuse you of fraudulent activities it's better to disappear for a while.

Using jump ships would cause a lot of beaurocratic waves so you make your way and bribe some freighter captain with your remaining credits.

Spending weeks in a dirty cabin with the permanent ear pinching humming noise of a class B freighter engine are not the amenities you're used to. But at least you are in the north sea now and try to make the rest of the way on your own.

Before entering the Skagerrak the captain dedicates an old cockle boat to you. This is all you get to make the rest of your way on your own. At least there is enough oxygen in your tanks to reach your destination: Lagertha Electrolyte Research Base in the cold, clear waters of the Norwegian Sea.

It should only be a journey of a few more days ...
